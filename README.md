# maracoos_currents_annotations
This repository contains csv files that contain annotations for reprocessed MARACOOS sea surface current data.

* At the northernmost edge of coverage in the Cape Cod region, vectors exhibiting slower/higher speeds than those of neighboring vectors should be viewed with caution. 

* At the easternmost edge of coverage in the Gulf Stream region, south and southeastward vectors exhibiting slower speeds than those of neighboring vectors should be viewed with caution. 
 
These vectors may result from the combination of a limited number of poor quality radials at the edge of data coverage.
